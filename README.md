#  CVE-API-Query

## Interacts with CIRCL CVE Search  API

###### Uses:
```python app.py -s/--search``` Requires -v/--vendor and -p/--product flags. Returns a list

of vulnerabilities specific to the vendor and product specified. 

Example: ```python app.py -s -v cisco -p firepower```

```python -app.py -b/--brows``` Requires -v/--vendor. Returns a list of vulnerabilities 

specific to the vendor specified. This list can get rather long.

Example: ```python app.py -b -v cisco``` 

Future additions: Currently returns a dictionary of CVEs. I plan to output that dictionary 

to a YAML file for easier reading. There will be other features to come as I mess with the 

API a little more.
